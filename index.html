                <p>Hola, I'm Robin. Born in Berlin, raised on the sunny shores of Lanzarote, and now back in Germany since 2008, currently residing in Hamburg.</p>

            <h2> About me</h2>
            <p>I'm a blend of rational thinking and creative flair, with a penchant for tech wizardry. Problem-solving is my jam, and I thrive on finding solutions while keeping the harmony intact.</p>
            <p>My current gig? Aspiring to be a Software Developer. In a previous life, I rocked the hotel reception in Spain and brought balance as an Osteopath in Germany. Both gigs had one thing in common - a client-oriented workstyle.</p>
            <p>When I'm not molding code, you'll find me in the zen zone, practicing meditation and yoga. But wait, there's more to me than inner peace - I'm also a PC-gaming and tabletop RPG nerd.</p>
            <p>My mission? To code my way towards a better world.</p>
            <p>Fun fact: Back in the '90s, I was the only kid in an adult computer course, where we dabbled in Qbasic programming. I was always the first to finish assignments because I couldn't wait to dive into PC games. My dad eventually pulled me out of the course. Who knows, maybe I'd be an AI genius today if he hadn't!</p>
            <p>Here's a little wisdom from me: "AI is very artificial but not very intelligent" (sorry, Chat GPT, no offense intended).</p>
